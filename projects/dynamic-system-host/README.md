# Dynamic System Host Example

This example demos a basic host application loading remote component.

- `app1` is the host application.
- `app2` standalone application which exposes `Widget` component.


# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `app1`, `app2` on ports `3001`, `3002` respectively.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) (HOST)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/) (STANDALONE REMOTE)
